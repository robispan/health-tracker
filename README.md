#HealthTracker App

The HealthTracker app is built with Create React App and React Router. React Context is used for global state management.

App consists of two main pages - Home page which contains ConnectCard components used for connecting with APIs, and Dashboard page that contains MetricsCard components which show collected data.

##HOMEPAGE

1. Strava card:
   Connect button redirects user to the Tracker app authorization page.
   Upon authorization user is redirected to a dedicated route that collect authorization code used for fetching oauth2 tokens. Context action is then used for fetching user data and setting it to context state.
   Refresh tokens are stored in sessionStorage (in production version tokens would ideally be stored on the backend) and accessed when Home page component is created (i.e. when user refreshes page or after they are redirected from one of the tracker apps authorization pages) to fetch oauth2 tokens. Context action for fetching user data is then called with access token payload.

2. Runkeeper card:
   Access token is used for getting access to API calls through get request. After authorization user is redirected to dedicated runkeeper route and context action for fetching user data is called. User data is then set to runkeeper context state.

##DASHBOARD
User metrics data is collected from context state and delegated to each of the MetricsCard components, which use react-circular-progressbar for rendering results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
